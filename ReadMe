This package adds additional digital inputs and relay outputs

The stock RPI Venus distribution includes two relays and two digital inputs

This script adds:
    the additional GPIO pins (5 total) to /etc/venus/gpio_list
    makes additional digital inputs available
    makes all digital inputs behave the same: pull up so they are active low

The Raspberry PI default is for the first 8 GPIO pins to have pull UPs
and the remaining have pull DOWNs. This makes some digital input pins behave differently
This script installs a DT overlay that switches to pull UPs for all digital input pins

Only the first relay can be assigned to a function: alarm, genertor start/stop or pump.
Others are only provided manual on/off control from the menu.

Adding additional relays to gpio_list causes systemcalc to crash
/opt/victronenergy/dbus-systemcalc-py/delegates/relaystate.py can be modified to prevent the crash
however the GUI needs to be modified to bring these relays to the user for on/off manual control

The ability to assign functions to other than the first relay requires significant rework to all
code that access relays - a significant effort
Changes to add more relay functionality is NOT part of this package!
but some code is in place but commented out
look in relaystate.py, gpio_list and later in this script

This script should be run manually initally.
It will then called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

Setup:

The easiest way to install this code IF the Venus device has internet access is to run the following command:

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/RpiGpioSetup/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/RpiGpioSetup-current /data/RpiGpioSetup

If not, run the following commands on a computer that does have internet access

wget https://github.com/kwindrem/RpiGpioSetup/archive/current.tar.gz
mv current.tar.gz RpiGpioSetup.tar.gz

then move the resulting .tar.gx file to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.


You must also install SetupHelper

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/SetupHelper-current /data/SetupHelper

or

wget https://github.com/kwindrem/TankRepeater/archive/current.tar.gz
mv current.tar.gz SetupHelper.tar.gz


Once both packages are installed run setup and follow the prompts.
/data/RpiGpioSetup/setup

You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.
